# Hate_Speech_Detection
In this project, we focus on **Hate speech detection** by analyzing a dataset of Twitter tweets. 
The goal is to identify and classify the intensity of hate speech in each comment/tweet, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 
By training a model on labeled data, we aim to categorize tweets based on varying levels of harmful or offensive language, ultimately contributing to better moderation of online platforms.
# Features
1.Custom Data Integration: Users can add their own data to the dataset, allowing for easy customization and expansion of the model.
2.Multiclass Classification: The model can categorize tweets into multiple levels of hate speech, from mild to extreme, for more granular insights.
3.Real-time Predictions: The system allows for real-time hate speech detection on new tweets or text input.
4.User-friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive interface to interact with the system, upload data, and view results.
5.Model Evaluation: Features like precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and ensure reliable results.
